Job Scheduler Project - TODO
✅ Completed Features
🏗️ Project Structure & Setup

✅ Monorepo Architecture - API and Worker services separated
✅ Docker Compose - Multi-container orchestration
✅ TypeScript Configuration - Both API and Worker with proper tsconfig
✅ Environment Management - .env files and validation

🌐 API Service

✅ Server Bootstrap - Express/Fastify setup with proper initialization
✅ Health Check Endpoint - /health for monitoring
✅ Job Management Routes - Create and list jobs endpoints
✅ DLQ Routes - View and retry dead letter jobs
✅ Job Data Model - Interface and type definitions
✅ Redis Client Setup - Connection pooling and configuration
✅ PostgreSQL Integration - Database connection and queries
✅ Centralized Logging - Structured logging utility
✅ Configuration Management - Redis, queue, and env configs

🔧 Job Service (Complete)

✅ createJob() - Add new jobs to queue
✅ fetchNextJob() - Retrieve next job from queue
✅ markJobProcessing() - Update job status to processing
✅ markJobCompleted() - Mark successful completion
✅ markJobFailed() - Handle job failures
✅ moveToDeadQueue() - Push poison jobs to DLQ
✅ retryJob() - Requeue failed jobs with backoff
✅ getJobStatus() - Query current job state
✅ getMetrics() - Job queue statistics

⚙️ Worker Service

✅ Worker Bootstrap - Process initialization
✅ Main Consume Loop - Continuous job polling
✅ Job Handlers - Email and Report handler examples
✅ Handler Registry - Dynamic handler routing
✅ Retry Strategy - Intelligent retry decision logic
✅ Exponential Backoff - Configurable delay calculation
✅ DLQ Producer - Dead letter queue management
✅ DLQ Types - Structured DLQ job definitions
✅ DLQ Metrics - Counter and statistics tracking
✅ Queue Consumer - Redis-based job consumption
✅ ACK System - Job acknowledgement handling
✅ Delayed Jobs - Schedule jobs for future execution
✅ Worker Configuration - Concurrency and polling settings

🔴 Redis Queue System

✅ Main Job Queue - Primary job processing queue
✅ Retry Queue - Failed job retry mechanism
✅ Dead Letter Queue - Poison job isolation
